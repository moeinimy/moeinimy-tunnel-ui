// Speed Limit: publish each account's effective rate to the patched Xray core.
//
// The policy is configured PER INBOUND but enforced PER EMAIL, because email is the
// account identity everywhere downstream (the unique key of client_traffics, the name
// RADIUS authenticates, the selector the per-account routing rules are built from).
// So every account on a limited inbound gets its OWN bucket at that rate: this is not
// a shared pool for the inbound, and an account's K devices share one bucket.
//
// The panel decides, Xray obeys. "Limit After" is resolved HERE against the usage the
// panel already tracks, and the core receives only the already-resolved rate. That
// keeps quota semantics (resets, VPN usage sourced from nft/RADIUS rather than Xray's
// own stats) in the one place that understands them, and keeps the fork patch small
// enough to rebase on every core bump.
//
// IP Limit rides the same sidecar, for the same reason: it is a per-account number the
// core needs at admission time and that changes without an Xray restart. It differs from
// the rates in three ways, all of them below: it is resolved from TWO columns rather than
// one (the inbound's default and the client's override, see resolveIPLimit), it has no
// "Limit After" (a concurrency rule is not a quota, so it applies from the first
// connection), and it is published only for inbounds whose source addresses the core can
// actually see (ipLimitEnforcedInCore).
//
// Its strategy (what to do AT the cap) rides along beside it, and is per inbound rather
// than per client, so an account on two inbounds resolves one strategy the same way it
// resolves one rate: see mergeIPLimitStrategy.
//
// The delivery path is a sidecar file, NOT the Xray config. A rate change must not
// touch anything in the xray.Config graph: Config.Equals would report a change and the
// debounced restart would drop every live connection on the box, and threshold
// crossings happen continuously as users consume data. For the same reason nothing
// here calls SetToNeedRestart.

// speedLimitUser is one account's published limits. Field order is fixed by this struct.
// The rates are BYTES PER SECOND and 0 in a direction means that direction is unlimited;
// ipLimit is a count of concurrent client source addresses and is omitted when 0, which
// the core reads as unlimited. An account that is unlimited in EVERY one of them is
// absent from the file entirely, so the core's common-case hot path is one map miss.
//
// strategy qualifies ipLimit and is omitted when it is the default ("reject"), so the
// core reads an absent strategy exactly as it reads an absent ipLimit: the safe default.
// Omitting the common value is not just brevity, it keeps the compare-then-write quiet:
// every byte that appears in the document is a byte that can differ between ticks.

//     one account owns a whole CIDR block, so a router behind that single link
//     legitimately presents many source addresses and a cap of K would refuse them.
//   - ssh and mtproto reach Xray over the LOOPBACK (ssh_socks.go dials the socks inbound
//     at 127.0.0.1, and mtproto's socks inbound listens on 127.0.0.1), so the core sees

// RegisterSpeedLimitInvalidation arms the dirty flag on every write to the inbounds
// table, and marks the limits dirty once so the first tick after startup republishes.
//
// A GORM callback, NOT a call at each edit site, and specifically not one hung off
// SetToNeedRestart. Hanging it there is the obvious move and it does not work: the panel
// calls SetToNeedRestart only in an `else if needRestart` branch, and the two paths that
// matter both miss it. A native inbound whose live del/add API call SUCCEEDS returns
// needRestart=false (see InboundService.UpdateInbound), which is exactly the measured
// repro; and a VPN inbound takes the on<Proto>Changed branch instead, so it never reaches
// the else at all. "Wanted a restart" is a proxy for "config changed" that is false
// precisely where this bug lives.
//
// The 30-odd SetToNeedRestart sites are the other option the research offered, and they
// are a hand-maintained list of the same shape this codebase has already been bitten by.
// A callback on the table cannot be forgotten by a future edit path: to change a
// published limit you must write this table, and every such write (panel, tgbot, LDAP
// sync, bulk ops) goes through GORM.
//
// The signal is deliberately COARSE: it fires for writes that cannot change a limit
// (the traffic job's up/down counters) and for statements a transaction later rolls back.
// Both are safe and cheap by design. A false positive costs one recompute that the
// compare-then-write in WriteSpeedLimits turns into no write at all, while a false
// negative is the bug. When in doubt, mark.
