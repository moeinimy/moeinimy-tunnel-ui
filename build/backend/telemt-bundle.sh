# build/backend/telemt-bundle.sh: build a static musl telemt (MTProto Proxy)
# from the PINNED third_party/telemt submodule.
#
# Runs INSIDE a rust:alpine (musl) container with the submodule mounted at /src.
# This mirrors build/core/build.sh (the patched Xray-core): the fork
# github.com/Sir-MmD/telemt pins upstream telemt 3.4.23 and carries our patch on
# top, so WHAT is built is recorded as a submodule commit in git rather than as a
# tarball URL plus a pile of local .patch files that could silently stop applying.
#
# The fork's patch (see its commit message) adds [access.user_modes]: per-ACCOUNT
# connection modes. vpn-ui exposes modes per client, which upstream's process-wide
# [general.modes] cannot express: without it the panel's per-client mode toggles
# would gate the LINKS we hand out but not the proxy itself.
#
# Why this is the SIMPLEST bundle in the tree:
#   - No plugins. Unlike accel-ppp/strongSwan/pppd (which dlopen their features and
#     need a relocatable tree + musl loader wrapper), telemt is one binary. It goes
#     in backend.go's flat `Daemons` manifest, needs no *BinPath branch in
#     procmgr.go's daemonBin(), and needs no tgz staleness gate.
#   - No runtime data files. Direct-to-DC mode carries a built-in DC address table,
#     so there is no proxy-secret / proxy-multi.conf to fetch at startup.
#   - No kernel module, no nftables, no capabilities beyond binding the listen port.
#
# Dep strategy (musl-static): rust:alpine's host triple IS x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
# and defaults to crt-static for musl, but RUSTFLAGS sets it explicitly so the recipe
# does not depend on that default. telemt's TLS is rustls/ring (pure Rust + asm), NOT
# OpenSSL: so no openssl-dev, no *-static archives, nothing to source-build.
# cmake/perl exist only because ring's build script probes for a C toolchain.
#
# Output: /out/telemt (verified statically linked). Consumed by backend.go's
# Daemons list via {Name:"telemt"}.
