// Package rbridge (Radius Bridge) is a light, parallel bridge that brings non-RADIUS VPN
// protocols (WireGuard, ikev2 psk/eap-tls, and future SSH/MTProto) into the RADIUS session
// model. Such protocols authenticate without a RADIUS round-trip, so they get no connect-time
// session record, no traffic counter, and no User-Limit gate from the normal path. Instead of
// each one cloning the ikev2-local reconcile/enforce/account logic, they implement the small
// Adapter interface and the Sweeper does the shared work once per traffic tick: poll live
// tunnels, enforce quota/disable plus User-Limit K and strategy by evicting, and hand the
// survivors to the existing session registry and nft accounting via the Sink.
//
// It runs ALONGSIDE the in-binary RADIUS server, which still owns the session store; it
// does not replace it. The RADIUS-authenticated protocols are unaffected.
